## Problem
It is difficult to get instant answers to our questions from a document which has large volume of data without reading the whole document content. 


## Solution

Using A360 AARI Process and tools like OpenAI, LangChain, and Pinecone, we can perform sophisticated searches on this data, allowing us to quickly and efficiently find the information we need. Retrieve relevant contexts to queries from Pinecone and pass these to OpenAI and LangChain to generate an answer backed by real data sources


## Results

Tested with different variety of documents with large data and results are meaningful & accurate. The solution is giving summarized answer for the question from the big data document.


## Function & Industry

This use case can be used in all the industries where we have a lot of questions about any document content.  The document can be a book , a legal contract , a product documentation etc.
